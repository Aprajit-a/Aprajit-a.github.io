<p align="justify">My name is <strong>Aprajita Srivastava</strong> and I am a <strong>Cloud Support Engineer</strong> at Amazon Web Services (AWS). It has been 1 year and 6 month since I joined Amazon and it's just as amazing as I am. The work life balance along with the salary is good enough to make me smile and glee. Though this pandemic halted my travel journey, I am still visiting places to keep up with my travel diary</p>

Recently I went to <strong> Bali </strong> and I had an amazing time there. My trip companions are mostly my parents and every place that I visit with them is special. Bali is the most beautiful place in this world. I would say It is like second heaven after Switzerland. when this trip was planned I was not that happy because I really wanted to go to Europe and I thought Bali would give me feeling of roaming around in India But when I reached there I felt like I have reached a fairy land.  We landed at the airport and then our resort was booked in Ubud. Ubud is another beauty of Bali surrounded by hills and rivers. We went to see their traditional dance performance and they showed some parts of Ramayan. It was wonderfully portrayed. Then we visited local temples and their famous resort four seasons. Bali is famous for it's spas so it was necessary to have that. I got my first spa experience in Bali.. it was so peaceful and relaxing... Everybody is so helpful and welcoming.. After Ubud our next stop was Ulluwatu, another beautiful destination located in south Bali.. it is surrounded by ocean and we planned to stay in a tree house there. They made it in the middle of jungle and one astonishing part about that place was they left the doors opened at night. There was no fear of robbery or crime. All the lights were off at night and you could experience something out of this world. Overall Bali was an amazing trip. A trip worth remembering and a trip that I will never ever forget

<p align="justify">Music has always been a mood lifter for me. I find solace in music. The medium, the tunes and the quality of lyrics have changed a lot but my taste remains same. You may find it interesting but my love life started because of music. One fine day we were sharing the songs we love and that sharing became much more meaningful for him. It was <strong> Pretty woman </strong> from kal ho na ho that was dedicated to me on my birthday, after that it has been on hell of a ride.

# **Friends**

<p align="justify">You'll be lying if you say , you don't need friends and you can manage everything by yourself. Because there will come a time you will need someone with you to hold your hand and take you out from the misery of life. There is a quote that friends are the family we choose and i find it apt. I have been blessed with a lot of great friends and i can proudly say i have learnt something from each of them. My friends from college helped me change my personality and become a better bold version of myself. TCS gave me the best lot I can ever ask for, They are not just my friends, They are my family. I enjoy every moment I am with them. AWS also gave me some good friends who made my work a little better and bearable. </p>
