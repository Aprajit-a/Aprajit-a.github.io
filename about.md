# *Hello* *Everyone*

<img src = "{{ site.url }}/assets/images/profile.jpeg">

<p align="justify">My name is <strong>Aman Kumar</strong> and I am a <strong>Computer Science</strong> Student at Vellore Institute of Technology . Presently i am in my final year of graduation and waiting to get placed in a decent company. I am mostly interested in <strong><i>Web development</i></strong> , i like it the most , then comes <strong><i>economics and finance</i></strong> though i am pursuing a B.Tech degree , i have a keen interest for these topics . </p>

Books are something which i love a lot now. And i am using the word <strong>love</strong> not <strong>like</strong> . To be honest i started reading just to impress my classmates that like them even i read alot . I was always fond of stories but reading thick books was never my cup of tea . But a 16 year old teenager wants to be the centre of attention . But at that time i never knew i would fall for books like this . From reading a small *Champak* book in a week to completing a book trilogy in 3 days ( <i>meluha trilogy</i> ) showed the increase of my interest and my reading speed .

I have a kindle now but i still love to buy  paperbacks as the smell of a fresh new book still makes me happy . Mythology mixed with thriller is my favourite genre and dan brown , ashwin sanghi and amish tripathi are my favourite writers . I have almost read all the books written by them and of many other writters too , currently my library consists of 64 books . And i hope to increase it to more than thousand.  I always try to read a book or two in a month . I have written few poetrys too which you can read in the blog section .

<p align="justify">Music has always been a mood lifter for me . I find solace in music . To listening songs of Md Rafi and kishore kumar in my mother's cassette player to listening arijit singh on online players. The medium , the tunes and the quality of lyrics have changed alot but my taste remains same .Soft melody with a meaningful lyrics is what i look for . I call these songs as soul soothers.  
Mostly i listen to bollywood songs , as bollywood has a song for every emotion (and literally for every word too) . Untill 2014 when i was in my class 10th , i think the only english songs i had ever listened to was <i>my heart will go on</i>from titanic and <i>waving flag</i> by k'naan . But thanks to my friends , those two are not the only ones i have listened till now . Coldplay , Imagine Dragons , linkinpark are the bands i like the most for english songs .
Everyone loves to have a playlist from which they don't have to specially select a song and whatever songs come on you can enjoy it so me and my friend <strong>Shaswat</strong> created a playlist of as i say <strong>soul soothers</strong> . You can have a go at it from the link below -:

# **Friends**

<p align="justify">You'll be lying if you say , you don't need friends and you can manage everything by yourself. Because there will come a time you will need someone with you to hold your hand and take you out from the misery of life. There is a quote that friends are the family we choose and i find it apt. I have been blessed with a lot of great friends and i can proudly say i have learnt something from each of them. </p>

<p align="justify">You need friends during school time and i was gifted with them . All of us live nearby and that made us board the same bus , and when you spend time with the same people all the time you are bound to become great friends . Though we have different streams , different ideologies and thoughts but we have one thing in common and that is crazy love for sports . </p>

<p align="justify">How lucky you would feel if the friends you had in school are there with you even in college. I'll tell you, it is a great feeling because you never feel the odd one out in a strange place , you never have to adjust to the new conditions all by yourself. Plus the discussion of school stories in college makes the memory even more fun. </p>

<p align="justify">But it's good to have some new friends too. You get to know about places you have never visited , Stories which you may have never heard and life lessons which would be useful for you. And your network increases too which is a pretty good thing to have in your college life . </p>
